# iMasina - car renting solution
## Made in colaboration with: @ctndavid
## Project idea
The last project of ** Automotive Software Engineering Course**, a course organized by *Continental Iasi*, required to create a solution for a car renting application, that will include a phone application, company backend and car entity with user interfaces.\
